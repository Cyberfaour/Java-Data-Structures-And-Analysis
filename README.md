# Java-Data-Structures-And-Analysis

## Data Structures Included
The repository contains Java implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is implemented as a separate Java class, providing a clean and modular approach. The following data structures are included in this repository:

1- `ArrayList`: An implementation of a dynamic array that can resize itself as needed. It provides methods for adding, accessing, and removing elements efficiently.

2- `LinkedList`: An implementation of a doubly linked list. It allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements at both ends of the list. It also provides methods for traversing the list and accessing elements.

3- `Maps`: Implementations of different map data structures, including HashMap and TreeMap. HashMap provides fast key-value pair lookups, while TreeMap maintains elements in sorted order based on their keys.

4- `PriorityQueue`: An implementation of a priority queue using a binary heap. It allows efficient retrieval of the highest-priority element. Elements can be inserted and removed from the priority queue based on their priority values.

5- `Queues`: Implementations of different queue data structures, including ArrayDeque and LinkedList-based queue. A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the end and removed from the front.

6- `Sorting`: Implementations of different sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. Sorting algorithms rearrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending, based on a comparison function.

7- `Stack`: An implementation of a stack using an array-based approach. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end.

8- `Trees`: Implementations of various tree data structures, including binary search trees and AVL trees. Trees are hierarchical structures that store elements in a specific order, making it efficient to search, insert, and delete elements.

Each data structure implementation is contained within its own Java class file, allowing you to use and import them independently based on your specific requirements.

For more details on each data structure and its usage, refer to the comments and method documentation within each class. The provided implementations aim to be efficient, reliable, and easy to understand, serving as a solid foundation for your projects.

Feel free to explore and utilize these data structures according to your needs, and don't hesitate to contribute to the repository if you have additional implementations or improvements to share.
